# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction
This scheduler will let you plan out your work day from 9am to 5pm. According to your current local time, the different time blocks will be color coded on whether that time has passed, has yet to come, or it is currently that time block. Any comments, messages, or data that is saved within a time block's description will remain on the page even after reloading the page.
